 AND curtailing the eating out habits of your loved ones! With modernized and 
 yet simple cooking methods,
 you are surely in for a flavorsome treat with our recipes that will surely make you the next talk

<li><p>Being Pakistan’s first digital food video portal,
 we understand your difficulty of being unable to execute that perfect dish just by going
through those long recipes and ending up with something not as good as the one you see on paper.
Hence, we make sure to get this covered by bringing in videos that will help
you prepare the same delicious food as you see in our videos.While we eliminate the
misconception that cooking is only for ladies, we make sure we live up to our statement where
we believe everyone can cook.NOTE: All the mom's kitchen content is copyright protected and
